        <p class="analyst-description">You love to dive into a complex problem and pull it apart in every way until the 
            answer’s found. You’re known for being extremely analytical and prefer to deal with 
            work linearly, in sequential order—finishing one thing before starting another. 
            Because you’re motivated by data and the accuracy of it, you are very process-
            oriented and prefer to take time to reflect on new ideas and thoughts.</p>

                <li>Brings forth research driven information to better inform the team’s decision;</li>
                <li>Meticulous for getting down to the hard facts of a situation, rather than rely on 
                    guesswork or assumptions;</li>
